# Vercel Deployment Issues & Solutions

## Overview
This document details all the issues encountered during the Vercel deployment of the SellSpark application and their root causes.

---

## 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors ‚ùå

### Issue
```
api/index.ts(462,48): error TS2339: Property 'userResponses' does not exist on type '{ id: number; updatedAt: Date; }'.
api/index.ts(467,31): error TS2339: Property 'websiteUrl' does not exist on type '{ id: number; updatedAt: Date; }'.
api/index.ts(468,36): error TS2339: Property 'businessSummary' does not exist on type '{ id: number; updatedAt: Date; }'.
api/index.ts(472,32): error TS2339: Property 'finalAnalysis' does not exist on type '{ id: number; updatedAt: Date; }'.
```

### Root Cause
The mock storage implementation returned incomplete objects when database initialization failed. The fallback storage methods (`getConsultationSession` and `getLastCompletedConsultationSession`) only returned `{ id, updatedAt }` but the code expected full session objects with all properties.

### Solution
Updated mock storage to return complete session objects with all required properties:
```typescript
getConsultationSession: async (id: number) => ({ 
  id, 
  websiteUrl: '',
  email: '',
  businessSummary: '',
  websiteAnalysis: '{}',
  userResponses: '{}',
  finalAnalysis: '',
  isComplete: false,
  currentStep: 0,
  updatedAt: new Date() 
})
```

## 2. Module System Conflicts ‚ùå

### Issue
```
Error: Cannot find module '../server/storage'
Require stack:
- /var/task/api/index.js
```

### Root Cause
1. Package.json had `"type": "module"` (ES modules)
2. API compilation used CommonJS output format
3. Vercel serverless functions couldn't resolve mixed module formats
4. Dynamic imports with CommonJS output created incompatible require() statements

### Solution
Switched API compilation to ES modules in `api/tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ES2022",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}
```

## 3. Express.js Runtime Crashes ‚ùå

### Issue
```
500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
This Serverless Function has crashed.
```

### Root Cause
1. Express.js middleware stack incompatible with Vercel's serverless architecture
2. Complex Express app initialization causing runtime overhead
3. Request/Response object mismatches between Express and Vercel's handler format
4. Express routes not properly wrapped for serverless execution

### Solution
Completely removed Express dependency and created a simple direct handler:
```typescript
export default async function handler(req: VercelRequest, res: VercelResponse) {
  // Direct request handling without Express
  const { method, url } = req;
  const path = url?.split('?')[0] || '';
  
  // Simple route matching
  if (path === '/api/health' && method === 'GET') {
    return res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
  }
  // ... other routes
}
```

## 4. API Route Structure Issues ‚ùå

### Issue
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/var/task/server/services/gemini'
404 Not Found on /api/consultation/start
```

### Root Cause
1. Vercel expects API routes in `/api` directory as individual functions
2. Initial setup had separate route files that Vercel couldn't recognize
3. Import paths breaking due to serverless function isolation
4. Services located outside API directory weren't bundled properly

### Solution
Consolidated all API routes into single `api/index.ts` file:
- Merged all endpoints into one handler
- Used path-based routing within the handler
- Removed complex service imports to avoid bundling issues

---

## 5. Database Connection Failures ‚ùå

### Issue
```
Error: DATABASE_URL must be set. Did you forget to provision a database?
Storage initialization error: Cannot find module 'ws'
```

### Root Cause
1. PostgreSQL/Neon database dependencies not available in serverless environment
2. WebSocket dependency for Neon not bundled correctly
3. Drizzle ORM initialization failing in serverless context
4. Environment variables not properly configured in Vercel

### Solution
Implemented graceful fallback when database fails:
```typescript
async function getStorage() {
  try {
    const { storage } = await import('../server/storage');
    return storage;
  } catch (error) {
    // Return mock storage for Vercel if database fails
    return mockStorage;
  }
}
```

---

## 6. CORS Configuration Issues ‚ùå

### Issue
```
Access to fetch at 'https://test-c-five.vercel.app/api/...' from origin 'https://test-c-five.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

### Root Cause
1. CORS headers not properly set for serverless functions
2. Preflight OPTIONS requests not handled
3. Express CORS middleware not available after removing Express

### Solution
Added manual CORS headers to handler:
```typescript
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH');
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With, Accept');

if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
  return res.status(200).end();
}
```

## 7. Build Output Configuration ‚ùå

### Issue
```
Error: No Output Directory named "public" found
Build failed
```

### Root Cause
1. Vercel couldn't find the frontend build output
2. Vite builds to `dist/public` but Vercel looked in wrong location
3. Build command and output directory misaligned

### Solution
Updated `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "framework": null
}
```

---

## 8. Chat Message State Issues ‚ùå

### Issue
```
[Chat] Homepage analysis complete, showing summary page -- When going to the chat I cant see anything it is blank and the first message which is sent by AI is not there
```

### Root Cause
1. Messages not persisted between API calls in serverless environment
2. Each serverless invocation has fresh memory state
3. No message storage mechanism for chat continuity
4. First AI message not being properly created or retrieved

### Solution
Implemented global message store for Vercel:
```typescript
declare global {
  var messages: any[] | undefined;
}

// Store messages in global scope
if (!global.messages) {
  global.messages = [];
}
```

---

## 9. API Endpoint Path Rewriting ‚ùå

### Issue
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
/api/free-build-submission not found
```

### Root Cause
1. Vercel's routing expects exact file paths for API routes
2. Rewrite rules conflicting with serverless function routing
3. Multiple API files causing routing confusion

### Solution
Added rewrite rules in `vercel.json`:
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/api/(.*)",
    "destination": "/api"
  }
]
```

---

## 10. Environment Variable Access ‚ùå

### Issue
```
process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY is undefined in production
Services not loading despite environment variables being set
```

### Root Cause
1. Environment variables not exposed to serverless functions
2. Build-time vs runtime environment variable access
3. Import statements executing before env vars available

### Solution
Used conditional service loading:
```typescript
if (process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY) {
  const geminiModule = await import('../server/services/gemini');
  services.gemini = geminiModule;
}
```

---

## Summary of Key Lessons

### ‚úÖ What Works on Vercel:
1. Single API handler file in `/api` directory
2. Simple request/response handling without frameworks
3. ES modules throughout the project
4. Mock/fallback implementations for external services
5. Direct path-based routing within handler
6. Global variables for state persistence (limited)

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work on Vercel:
1. Express.js or complex middleware stacks
2. Multiple API route files
3. Mixed module systems (CommonJS + ESM)
4. Direct database connections without fallbacks
5. Complex service imports and dependencies
6. Assuming persistent memory between invocations

### üîß Best Practices for Vercel Deployment:
1. Keep API handlers simple and self-contained
2. Always implement fallbacks for external services
3. Use consistent module system (preferably ES modules)
4. Handle CORS manually in serverless functions
5. Test locally with `vercel dev` before deploying
6. Use environment variables carefully with proper checks
7. Consolidate API logic into minimal files
8. Implement proper error handling and logging

- Working API endpoints
- Proper CORS handling
- Functional forms and chat interface
