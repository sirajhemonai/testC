2 Adaptive Q&A Graph (“Discovery Loop 2.0”)
Turns the existing six‑step chat into a data‑driven scoring engine that refines suggestions in‑session.

Stage	Incremental Upgrade	Stack
2.1 Pain taxonomy	Assign each question to one of eight core friction buckets (Lead Flow, Follow‑Up, Onboarding, Accountability, Content, Upsell, Retention, Admin).	YAML config
2.2 Real‑time scoring	After every answer, Gemini 1.5 Flash calls updatePainMatrix()—a simple JSON object {bucket: cumulativeScore} (scale 0–10). The highest bucket at any moment determines the next question via Pinecone search for “greatest information gain”.	Gemini 1.5 Flash, Pinecone
2.3 Micro‑persona fork	Once two buckets surpass a 7/10 score, the system assigns the user to one of five pre‑built coach personas (Solo Scaling Sally, Content‑Crushed Carl, etc.). This persona adds a weight to recipe ranking so suggestions feel even more bespoke.	Rules engine
2.4 Confidence‑indexed output	Final analyzeBusinessForAutomation() (Gemini 2.5 Pro) receives both the PainMatrix and PersonaID. It returns:
• A ranked list of automations (score, pain addressed, effort score)
• “Why we chose this” sentences that quote the coach’s own words (boosts perceived relevance).	Gemini 2.5 Pro

Why it wins: Interactive personalisation without asking more questions. The user sees the list evolve as they answer, making the AI feel consultative instead of prescriptive.

.3 Explain‑like‑I’m‑5 translator	GPT‑4o (via function call) ingests the raw JSON and emits:
• A one‑line headline (“Expected to save you ~14 hrs/mo and pay back in 11 days”).
• A badge colour (green / orange / red) for risk.	OpenAI GPT‑4o

Visual UX	In the results page, display a mini‑bar chart of payback days plus the badge—makes the decision obvious.

using this startegy improve the recommendation system.
