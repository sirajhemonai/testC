💬 Section 4: What Coaches Say
“I don’t love tech... but this actually helped me get 3 more calls booked last week — without me doing anything.”
— Business Coach (solo)

“Now I send my welcome forms, onboarding emails, and program link in 20 seconds — not 20 minutes.”
— Fitness Coach (online programs)

🧠 Section 5: Built From Coach Frustrations, Not AI Hype
These automations solve problems like:

“I forget to follow up”

“I’m tired of chasing clients”

“My sales calls are all over the place”

“I’m spending too much time on admin”

“I keep getting ghosted after the first session”

No buzzwords. No over-promises. Just systems that make your coaching life easier.
